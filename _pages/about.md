I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Machine Learning at **Imperial College London**, where I work in the research group led by [Professor Samir Bhatt](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/s.bhatt). I am also part of the [Machine Learning and Global Health Network](https://mlgh.net).  

My research focuses on **probabilistic and geometric machine learning**, with an emphasis on their intersection and applications to real-world problems.

I hold a BSc in **Theoretical Physics** from King’s College London (2018) and a Master of Advanced Studies in **Applied Mathematics** (Part III of the Mathematical Tripos, 2019) from the University of Cambridge. I completed my **PhD in Mathematics** at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in *Mathematics of Random Systems* (Imperial & Oxford), under the supervision of [Eyal Neuman](https://eyaln13.wixsite.com/eyal-neuman) and [Damiano Brigo](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/damiano.brigo).  

Between 2022 and 2024, I worked as a **Quantitative Researcher** at Virtu Financial before returning to academia.  

You can find a full list of my work on my [Publications page](/publications) or on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RYoj-W0AAAAJ). I welcome discussions and collaborations—please feel free to contact me at **a.micheli19 [at] imperial [dot] ac [dot] uk**.
